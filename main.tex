\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Why do we look at challenges of Manufacturing?}


\begin{frame}{Why do we look at challenges in Manufacturing?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Important to check the sanity of the manufacturing.
    \item Is it producing what it is supposed to be producing?
    \item Are the analytics used in the decision making any sense? \\ Eg: Confusion matrix.
    \item What are the cost associated w.r.t. metrology used? \\ Eg: Time, Complexity and Design.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Challenges in Manufacturing and Quality Control}

\subsection{Size}

\begin{frame}{Size}{Eg: Fasteners, Sub-parts, etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item { Items manufactured by one process must be of same/specified size.
        \pause }
  \item Whole point (!) of production (Custom or Mass).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{size}
    \caption{Production batch in which item no.$3$ \& $4$ are oversized by $\Delta$x \& $\Delta$y units respectively.}
    \label{fig:size_line}
  \end{figure}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Orientation}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Orientation}{Eg: PCBs, Masks, Sub-parts etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Similarly, items produced by single process must be of same/specific orientation.
  \item Or no anomaly expected in the orientation.
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{orientation}
    \caption{Anomaly in the production of item no. $3$. The item has a defect in its orientation by an angle of $\Delta\theta^\circ$.}
    \label{fig:orientation_line}
  \end{figure}
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  %\item<3-> {
  %  Third item.
  %}
  %\item<4-> {
  %  Fourth item.
  %}
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  %\item<5-> {
  %  Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  %}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Tolerance}

\begin{frame}{Tolerance}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Needed for better judgement of quality of product.\\
  Eg: Allowance for $\Delta$x, $\Delta$y and $\Delta\theta$
  \item The errors occurred in measuring the parameters are due to actual physical error or analytical methods used or could be due to vibrations.
  \item It is important to know the source of error to precisely measure the parameters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Time}

\begin{frame}{Time}{Eg: Sorting in industries}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Very crucial when the throughput is of importance.\\
  Eg: Japanese recycling industry. $2$ tonne in $1$ hr.!
  \item The decision making analytical methods must have low \\
  (or no) complexity.
  \item Linear models are preferable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Fault Detection using Multivariate Analysis}

\subsection{Production Model and Anomalies}

\begin{frame}{Production Model}{Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each product is scanned with a camera on top.
    \item The image is thresholded using standard methods. \\
    Eg: Otsu's global and Adaptive thresholds to mention a few.
    \item A batch size of $N$ frames considered.
    \item Images are sumulated with a series of binary images of size $50\times50$ pixels.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{model}
