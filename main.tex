\section{Why do we look at challenges of Manufacturing?}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}{Why do we look at challenges in Manufacturing?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Important to check the sanity of the production.
    \item Is it producing what it is supposed to be producing?
    \item Are the analytics used in the decision making any sense? \\ Eg: Confusion matrix.
    \item What are the cost associated w.r.t. metrology used? \\ Eg: Time, Complexity and Design.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Challenges in Manufacturing and Quality Control}

\subsection{Size}

\begin{frame}{Size}{Eg: Fasteners, Sub-parts, etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item { Item in production line must be of same/specified size.
        \pause }
  \item Whole point (!) of production (Custom or Mass).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{size}
    \caption{Production line in which item no.$3$ \& $4$ are oversized by $\Delta$x \& $\Delta$y units respectively.}
    \label{fig:size_line}
  \end{figure}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Orientation}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Orientation}{Eg: PCBs, Masks, Sub-parts etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Similarly, item in production line must be of same/specific orientation.
  \item Or no anomaly in the expected orientation.
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{orientation}
    \caption{Anomaly in the production of item no. $3$. The item is rotated by an angle of $\Delta\theta^\circ$.}
    \label{fig:orientation_line}
  \end{figure}
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  %\item<3-> {
  %  Third item.
  %}
  %\item<4-> {
  %  Fourth item.
  %}
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  %\item<5-> {
  %  Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  %}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Tolerance}

\begin{frame}{Tolerance}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Needed for better judgement of quality of product.
  \item The errors occurred in measuring the parameters are due to actual physical error or analytical methods used or could be due to vibrations.
  \item It is important to know the source of error to precisely measure the parameters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Time}

\begin{frame}{Time}{Eg: Sorting in industries}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Very crucial when the throughput is of importance.
  \item The decision making analytical methods must have low (or no) complexity.
  \item Linear models are preferable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Second Main Section}

\subsection{Another Subsection}

\begin{frame}{Blocks}
\begin{block}{Block Title}
You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title
\end{block}
\begin{theorem}
There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
Here is an example of an example block.
\end{example}
\end{frame}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
    \item
      Something else you haven't solved.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
