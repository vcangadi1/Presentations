\section{Why do we look at challenges of Manufacturing?}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}{Why do we look at challenges in Manufacturing?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Important to check the sanity of the production.
    \item Is it producing what it is supposed to be producing?
    \item Are the analytics used in the decision making any sense? \\ Eg: Confusion matrix.
    \item What are the cost associated w.r.t. metrology used? \\ Eg: Time, Complexity and Design.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Challenges in Manufacturing and Quality Control}

\subsection{Size}

\begin{frame}{Size}{Eg: Fasteners, Sub-parts, etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item { Items produced by one process must be of same/specified size.
        \pause }
  \item Whole point (!) of production (Custom or Mass).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{size}
    \caption{Production batch in which item no.$3$ \& $4$ are oversized by $\Delta$x \& $\Delta$y units respectively.}
    \label{fig:size_line}
  \end{figure}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Orientation}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Orientation}{Eg: PCBs, Masks, Sub-parts etc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Similarly, items produced by single process must be of same/specific orientation.
  \item Or no anomaly in the expected orientation.
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{orientation}
    \caption{Anomaly in the production of item no. $3$. The item is rotated by an angle of $\Delta\theta^\circ$.}
    \label{fig:orientation_line}
  \end{figure}
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  %\item<3-> {
  %  Third item.
  %}
  %\item<4-> {
  %  Fourth item.
  %}
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  %\item<5-> {
  %  Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  %}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Tolerance}

\begin{frame}{Tolerance}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Needed for better judgement of quality of product.
  \item The errors occurred in measuring the parameters are due to actual physical error or analytical methods used or could be due to vibrations.
  \item It is important to know the source of error to precisely measure the parameters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Time}

\begin{frame}{Time}{Eg: Sorting in industries}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Very crucial when the throughput is of importance.
  \item The decision making analytical methods must have low (or no) complexity.
  \item Linear models are preferable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Fault Detection using Multivariate Analysis}

\subsection{Production Model and Anomalies}

\begin{frame}{Production Model}{Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each product is scanned with a camera on top.
    \item The image is thresholded using standard methods. \\
    Eg: Otsu's global and Adaptive thresholds to mention a few.
    \item A batch size of $N$ frames considered.
    \item Images are sumulated with a series of binary images of size $50\times50$ pixels.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{model}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Production Model and Anomalies}{Size and Orientation}
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{anomalies_model}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Principle Component Analysis}

\begin{frame}{Results from $N = 5$}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item results of $N = 5$ of both Size and Orientation.
    \item top left Variance of PC for Size
    \item top right biplot PC1 vs PC2 for Size
    \item bottom left Variance of PC for Orientation
    \item bottom right biplot PC1 vs PC2 for Orientation
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Testing the robustness of the method}

\begin{frame}{Robustness of PCA}{$N = 100$, Gaussian noise $\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 2$}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $2\times 3$ subplots
    \item Noisy binary image, Latent, biplot for Size
    \item Noise binary image, latent, biplot for orientation
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Blocks}
%\begin{block}{Block Title}
%You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title
%\end{block}
%\begin{theorem}
%There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.
%\end{theorem}
%\begin{example}
%Here is an example of an example block.
%\end{example}
%\end{frame}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \alert{random} number of Image size, Batch size, Num of faulty images, $\Delta\theta$ and Sizes of items are tested with PCA methods.
  \item PCA is a linear model. Hence \alert{fast} decision maker.
  \item \alert{Simpler}, \alert{Cost effective} metrological method of fault detection in manufacturing and quality control.
  \end{itemize}
